    "_Types_ can be a way to tie your computation to your narrative. _Formatters_ can also reduce the visual complexity of reading code. While adoption of the Language Server Protocol will add a whole other level of interoperability, having these tools live _in your kernel_ have benefits from a number of points of view: you usually don't have to start a separate process, and there is likely less language-language impedence.\n",
